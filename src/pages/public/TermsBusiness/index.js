          5.2 Role and Responsibility of Lablaco in relation to sold and given
          Wearables
        </h2>
        <p>
          You, as a Seller, are responsible for the Wearables sold and given by
          you through the Platform. Lablaco bears no responsibility nor holds
          any commitment in relation to any obligation arising out of the sale
          contract (“Shop Contract”), of the gift contract (“Give Contract”) or
          prescribed to you by law.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, Lablaco is no party to any Shop Contract nor Give
          Contract, and, towards the Private Users, Lablaco does not in any case
          act as an intermediary of the Seller, for the purposes of Article 3 of
          the Italian Law Decree 206/2005 (“Italian Consumer Law”).{" "}
        </p>
        <h2>5.3 Lablaco Shop</h2>
        <p>
          Lablaco Shop is the area on Lablaco dedicated to the sale of Wearables
          by Sellers to Private Users. On Lablaco Shop you can sell Wearables,
          eventually worn and promoted by the Influencers, directly to Private
          Users, upon payment of the Purchase Price executed by the Private User
          directly on the Platform.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          We remind you that Lablaco offers the Private User the option to (i)
          purchase the Wearable for himself, by clicking on the “
          <strong>Buy button</strong>” or to (ii) purchase the Wearable as a
          present for another Private User registered on Lablaco, by clicking on
          the “<strong>Surprise button</strong>”.
        </p>
        <p>
          In both cases, the sale of the Wearable will occur between the Seller
          and the Private User through the features made available on the
          Platform. Lablaco will not take part in the sale and will not be a
          party to such Shop Contract executed between you and the Private User.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>We thus remind you that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            purchasing the Wearable as a consumer, the Private User is entitled
            to all statutory warranties and rights set forth by all applicable
            mandatory consumer law of the country in which the consumer resides;
          </li>
          <li>
            if the Shop Contract has been executed through the “Surprise
            button”, the same statutory warranties and rights foreseen for the
            Private User also apply to the person indicated by the Private User
            as the receiver of the Wearable, who will thus be able to exercise
            his warranties and rights against you.{" "}
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>5.3.1 How is the Shop Contract executed?</h3>
        <p>
          In order to execute the Shop Contract, the Private User will: (i)
          choose and select the Wearable he intends to purchase; (ii) fill in
          the details of the receiver of the Wearable, in the case of a purchase
          through the “<strong>Surprise button</strong>”; (iii) specify the
          shipping address (“<strong>Shipping Address</strong>”); (iv) provide
          credit / debit card details in order to execute the payment of the
          purchase price (“<strong>Purchase Price</strong>”) and of other
          related expenses (“<strong>Other Expenses</strong>”); (v) carefully
          verify the correctness of all the details and information provided and
          contained in the purchase summary page (“
          <strong>Purchase Summary Page</strong>”); (vi) press on the “
          <strong>Buy button</strong>” or on the “
          <strong>Surprise button</strong>” at the end of the Purchase Summary
          Page, thereby sending you a formal purchase offer (“
          <strong>Purchase Offer</strong>”) for the Wearable.
        </p>
        <p>
          We kindly invite you to refer to Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the T&amp;C
          All Users, for a thorough explanation of the different execution
          phases of the Shop Contract with the Private User.
        </p>
        <h3>5.3.2 Acceptance of a Purchase Offer</h3>
        <p>
          The display of a Wearable through Lablaco and the publication of a
          related sale offer implies that the Wearable is available in stock,
          and thus entails the possibility to execute the Shop Contract with
          immediate acceptance of the Purchase Offer submitted by the Private
          User.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we remind you that, as a Seller, you have the right to accept
          or refuse such Purchase Offer, in relation to the effective
          availability of the Wearable and to the location of the shipping
          address indicated by the Private User, unless otherwise specified by
          specific provisions contemplated in the applicable consumer protection
          laws of the Private User’s country of residence. In such a case, the
          display of a Wearable through Lablaco and the publication of a related
          sale offer is binding upon you, once acceptance of the Purchase Offer
          is submitted by the Private User.
        </p>
        <h3>5.3.3 Confirmation E-Mail</h3>
        <p>
          We underline that it is your responsibility as a Seller to communicate
          your acceptance of the Purchase Offer, thereby sending to the Private
          User confirmation of the effective conclusion of the Shop Contract as
          well as of the shipping of the Wearable (“Confirmation E-Mail”). The
          Shop Contract between you and the Private User will thus be treated as
          entered into on the date of the Confirmation E-Mail and it will refer
          exclusively to those items listed in the Confirmation E-Mail.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The Confirmation E-Mail shall contain information on the purchased
          Wearable(s), a copy of the Shop Contract between you and the Private
          User, the information regarding the right of withdrawal and the form
          to exercise it, and the receipt of the purchase. It shall also
          precisely indicate the VAT, all applicable taxes paid for such
          transaction as well as any further information required by law. A copy
          of the Shop Contract and of any additional contractual document
          relating to such transaction, shall be stored and made accessible to
          the Private User in his Account page on Lablaco.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that the Private User has the possibility to add to, amend
          or cancel his order after you send the Confirmation E-Mail, for up to
          two hours after receiving the Confirmation E-Mail.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Lablaco is by no means party to the Shop Contract executed solely
          between the Seller and the Private User, Lablaco shall not be held
          liable for any miscommunication or misinformation or for any violation
          arising out of such obligation caused by the Seller.
        </p>
        <h3>5.3.4 Payment and Authorization to collect payment</h3>
        <p>
          Simultaneously to the Confirmation E-Mail, Lablaco shall collect, in
          the name and on behalf of the Seller, the payment of the Purchase
          Price and, if the case may be, of the Other Expenses directly from the
          credit/debit card of the Private User, as expressly authorized by the
          Private User upon registration to the Platform. To this end, by
          accepting these T&amp;C and upon Registration of your Business
          Account, you, as a Seller, expressly authorize Lablaco to collect the
          payment of the Purchase Price and, if due, of all Other Expenses, in
          your name and on your behalf, via the Platform.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          You also hereby authorize Lablaco to withhold an amount equal to 20%
          of the collected Purchase Price (+ VAT), as additional fee for the use
          of the Services (“Additional Fee”). Lablaco shall keep the Purchase
          Price, decreased by the Additional Fee – in accordance with Article
          5.7. below - for 30 days (“Decreased Purchase Price”). Lablaco
          undertakes to release the Decreased Purchase Price in favor of the
          Seller after 30 days from collection. In case of offline purchases by
          Private Users, Lablaco will not withhold any Additional Fee.
        </p>

          We remind you that, for the Give Contract to be fully effective, the
          Receiver will need to expressly declare his intention to accept the
          donated Wearable, by clicking the “Accept button” (or “Get button” in

          Lablaco a contract (“Delivery Contract”), in the framework of which
          Lablaco will provide for the delivery of the donated Wearable through

        <p>
          Please note that the Sellers on Lablaco have the possibility to
          contact you, as Influencer or Magazine, via the Lablaco Chat in order
          to agree with you on a higher Promotion Fee for your advertising
          activities regarding the Wearables of such specific Seller.

          you, as Influencer or Magazine, via the Lablaco Chat in order to
          propose to you collaborations in relation to the Promotion Activities.
          In such a case, for every sale concluded between the Seller and a
          Private User on the Platform as a direct consequence of the Private
          User’s redirection to the Seller’s Account from your Account and/or
          post made in collaboration with an Agency, the Agency will be entitled
          to receive from the Seller the above specified Promotion Fee.{" "}

        <p>
          Lablaco undertakes to withhold the Promotion Fee at the moment of
          payment, by the Private User, of the applicable Purchase Price and to
          release it to you after 30 days from the conclusion between the Seller
          and the Private User of the respective Shop Contract and from the
          complete collection of the applicable Purchase Price.{" "}

          Platform and/or on other social networks, containing the weblink to
          the Seller’s Account on Lablaco. A simple re-post which does not
          contain the weblink to the Seller’s Account on Lablaco does not
          redirect the Private User to the Seller’s Account on Lablaco and will
          thus not entitle you to any Promotion Fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that you are not entitled to receive any Promotion Fee in
          case the Shop Contract is being concluded as a consequence of your

          Further, you are not entitled to receive and you are obliged to give
