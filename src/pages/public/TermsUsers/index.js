          The Confirmation E-Mail shall constitute proof of purchase of the
          Wearable and, together with a copy of the Shop Contract and of any
          additional contractual document relating to such transaction, shall be
          stored and made accessible on your Account page on Lablaco.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          We suggest you to always print out a copy of the Confirmation E-Mail
          and save it for your own records.

        <p>
          Should the Seller refuse your Purchase Offer, then the Shop Contract
          would not be executed and would not be effective: as a consequence, no
          payment would be charged.{" "}

        <h2>7.4 Payment</h2>
        <p>
          Simultaneously to the Confirmation E-Mail, you as a Private User
          expressly authorize Lablaco to collect the payment of the Purchase
          Price and, if the case may be, of the Other Expenses directly from
          your credit/debit card, in the name and on behalf of the Seller who
          delegated Lablaco to this purpose, only in the case of Seller’s
          acceptance of the Purchase Offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Purchase Offer is related to a number of Wearables, only the
          Purchase Price and the Delivery Costs and Expenses of the Wearables
          for which the Shop Contract has been duly executed after Seller’s
          acceptance via Confirmation E-Mail will be charged.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that the payment of the Purchase Price and the Delivery
          Costs and Expenses were to fail, we will inform you via e-mail. By
          accessing Your Account page, you will have a second attempt to
          finalize the payment, if the case may be by selecting an alternative
          payment method. The Wearable will not be shipped unless the Seller has
          effectively received the Purchase Price (including Delivery Costs and
          Expenses). If within 10 days of having received the E-mail
          Confirmation, you fail to proceed with the payment, the relevant
          contract with the Seller shall be considered ineffective. On your
          Account Page you will thus find a cancellation notice of the purchase.{" "}

          7.5 Errors in relation to the Purchase Price or Delivery Costs and
          Expenses
        </h2>
        <p>
          In the event that the Seller has entered incorrect information
          regarding the Purchase Price or other relevant Delivery Costs and
          Expenses, you will receive a correction e-mail (“Correction E-Mail”).
          In such case, you would be given the choice to annul or re-confirm
          your Purchase Offer at the correct price.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should you not confirm your Purchase Offer within 5 days from the
          Correction E-Mail, then your Purchase Offer will be considered
          ineffective. You will find a cancellation notice on your Account page.{" "}

          When selecting the “Surprise” button, the Wearable will be delivered

          Through Lablaco Shop, you will purchase a Wearable from the Seller.
          You therefore have the possibility to exercise a series of rights and
          warranties given to you by the mandatory consumer law applicable in
          your country of residence, in relation to online purchases. When you

          those are the rights which you may exercise against the Seller:
        </p>
        <h4>Right of withdrawal</h4>
        <p>
          If for any reason, you were not satisfied with the purchased Wearable,
          you may withdraw from the Shop Contract executed with the Seller and
          return the purchased Wearable within 14 days from the date of

        <p>Thus, we remind you that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            in order to validly exercise the right of withdrawal you shall
            inform the Seller about your decision within, at the latest, 14 days
            from the date of delivery of the Wearable. To contact the Seller
            directly through Lablaco, you may follow the Withdrawal Instructions

            Withdrawal Form within 14 days at the very latest from the date of

            you can download from the following page{" "}

            Wearable;
          </li>
          <li>
            alternatively, you may contact the Seller directly, stating your

            required to return the Wearable yourself to the Seller within 14
            days since the date on which you communicated your withdrawal;
            unless the Seller offers to cover for the expenses, you will
            directly bear the cost of returning the Wearable;
          </li>
          <li>
            if the Wearables have been over handled and overused, more than what
            is normally required in order to assess the nature, features and
            functioning of the purchased Wearable, you may be held responsible
            for the loss of value of the Wearable;

          period of two years, from the date of delivery of the sold Wearable.{" "}

          Lablaco may perform modifications to the Platforms and/or Lablaco
          Services in order to introduce new Services and/or improve the
          existing Services, their accessibility and/or functioning, or, if the

          Art. 17 of these T&amp;C All Users.
        </p>
        <h1>17. Amendments to T&amp;C All Users</h1>
        <p>
          We reserve ourselves the right to modify these T&amp;C All Users at
          any time, which you may always refer to by accessing the most
          up-to-date version on the Platforms. In the event of a significant
          change to one or more provisions, we will notify you at least 30 days
          in advance before their entrance into force, by sending you a message
          on your Lablaco Account. In such case, should you not agree with the
          stated provisions, you will have the right to terminate these T&amp;C
          All Users executed with Lablaco with immediate effect, in accordance
          with the information and procedures described in the e-mail. If,
          however, you continue to use the Platforms after the introduction of
          such new provisions, you expressly declare the acceptance of the
          amended T&amp;C All Users. We therefore invite you to read carefully
          any emails you may receive from us.{" "}
        </p>
        <h1>18. Duration and Termination of the T&amp;C All Users</h1>
        <p>
          All provisions of the T&amp;C All Users executed between you and
          LABLACO HOLDING PTE LTD will remain in full force until the T&amp;C All Users
          is terminated (i) as a result of your withdrawal, (ii) as a result of
          a termination by Lablaco, in accordance with the provisions of this
          paragraph.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          You may terminate these T&amp;C All Users at any time by clicking on
          the “Delete Account” button available on the Platforms, without giving
          any reason for your decision.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Lablaco may terminate these T&amp;C All Users with immediate effect
          and without notice (i) if you breach any of your obligations under
          these T&amp;C All Users, (ii) if, by using the Platforms and/or its
          Services, you violate a right of Lablaco, of a licensor of Lablaco, of
          a Seller, of another User or a third party, (iii) if Lablaco has
          received at least two notifications from other Users or Sellers
          reporting a behavior in relation to the use of the Platforms and/or its
          Services, which may constitute a breach of these T&amp;C All Users
          and/or other legal provisions, and (iv) in the event of serious and
          repeated breaches of the contracts executed with other Users of the
          Platforms of which we become aware.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Agreement is terminated – as a result of your withdrawal or our
          request for termination –we will block your User Account without
          delay. You will therefore no longer be able to access any of your
          Content, which will also be no longer visible on the Platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the rights granted by Lablaco under these T&amp;C All Users
          will remain unaffected, including the right to post your Content and
          the right to License referred to in paragraph 14.3 above. If, at the
          time of termination of these T&amp;C All Users, you have purchased,
          sold or given away items through Lablaco, the contracts with the other
          Users and the delivery mandate thereof shall remain in force until
          their full and final execution.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the above, Lablaco shall not be liable where one or
          more of the Content posted or shared on the Platforms by the User is –
          even after termination of these T&amp;C All Users and deletion of the
          Account – in whole or in part used, reproduced, copied, modified,
          altered, publicly displayed, posted, sent, transmitted, distributed,
          transferred or otherwise used.{" "}

          <strong>
            {" "}
            LABLACO HOLDING PTE LTD as well as its subsidiaries, affiliates and related
            parties who contributed towards hosting services, the development of
            content and services of the Platforms, will not be liable for direct
            or indirect damages resulting from the use of Platforms or from the
            failure to offer such services. This provision as well as all
            provisions of these T&amp;C All Users containing exclusion or
            limitation clauses related to the liability of Lablaco or its
            subsidiaries, affiliates and related parties shall be intended in
            the broadest sense possible, but shall however be applied within the
            limits of the applicable law and regulation of your country of
            residence. In any case, they will not be applicable in cases of
            willful misconduct and gross negligence, where the damage consists
            of an injury to physical integrity or health and if the violation by
            Lablaco, its subsidiaries, affiliates and related parties amount to
            a breach of mandatory public order laws.{" "}

        <p>
          <strong>
            {" "}
            By using the Platforms, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless
            Lablaco, its affiliates, subsidiaries and related parties,
            directors, employees and contractors, from any loss, direct or
            indirect damage, liability, cost, expense (including legal fees),

            Users; and (iii) your breach of any third party rights, including

        </p>
        <h1>21. Online dispute resolution (UE)</h1>
        <p>
          To file a complaint or claim any of your rights related to the use of
          the Platforms or to the purchase Wearables, you have the option to use
          the Online Dispute Resolution Platforms (“ODR Platform”), established
          by the European Commission and delivered in all European languages,
          via the following website of the European Commission:{" "}
          <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/">
            https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of purchase through Lablaco Shop, the Seller will be the
          only subject responsible for all claims concerning your Shop Contract.
          As a consequence, if you were to use the ODR Platforms in order to
          claim your rights arising out of the Shop Contract, you would need to
          specify the Seller of the purchased Wearable as professional from
          which you bought the Wearable or else as counter party in the dispute.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          If, on the other hand, you intend to use the ODR Platforms to enforce
          your rights or file a complaint under the T&amp;C All Users entered
          into with LABLACO HOLDING PTE LTD, you shall then indicate Lablaco, as the
          retailer from whom you purchased the service, or as the counterparty
          of the related dispute.{" "}
        </p>
        <h1>22. Waiver and Safeguard clause</h1>
        <p>
          Failing to rigorously ask to enforce any of the terms and conditions
          of these T&amp;C All Users shall not be construed as a waiver for the
          enforcement of any further breach. If any part of these T&amp;C All
          Users were found invalid or unenforceable under the applicable law or
          Court order, including any warranty disclaimers or limitation of
          liability set forth above, the invalid or unenforceable provision
          shall be considered severed by a valid and enforceable provision that
          is consistent with the meaning of the original provision. The rest of
          these T&amp;C All Users would still be binding and would remain in
          full effect.{" "}

        <h1>23. Governing law and Jurisdiction</h1>
        <p>
          The contract executed with Lablaco ruled by the General T&amp;C (which
          include these T&amp;C All Users, the Privacy Policy and the Cookie
          Policy) and all rights and obligations of the parties are governed by
          and construed in accordance with the laws of Italy, save for all other
          mandatory applicable law which cannot be derogated or excluded by the
          Parties.{" "}
